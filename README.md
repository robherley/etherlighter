## Setup

1. Make sure you have a UniFi device with Etherlighting adopted into your network.
1. Find the IP address of the device you want to connect to. This can be found in the "UniFi Devices" tab in Unifi Network.
1. Get your device authentication credentials under Settings > System > Advanced.
1. (Optional) Add an RSA SSH key for passwordless authentication.
1. Build it: `go build`
2. Run it: `./etherlighter -device <ip> -user <username>`
   - For usage: `./etherlighter -help`

## How does it work

This program will establish an SSH connection to your UniFi device and execute commands that adjust the Etherlighting options. To achieve this, most of the operations involve writing to a procfs file (`/proc/led/*`) with different reverse engineered configurations. Searching the device's filesystem, you can find references to different scripts (e.g. in `/etc/rc.d`) that write to files in that directory.
